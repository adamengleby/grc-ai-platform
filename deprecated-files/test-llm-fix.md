# LLM Tool Orchestration Fix - Test Guide

## Problem Summary
The LLM was receiving tool results but presenting errors like:
- "Error searching records: undefined"
- "Application 'placeholder_application_name' not found"
- Generic analysis instead of actual tool results

## Root Cause
The LLM wasn't properly instructed on how to access the tool result data structure. Tool results were being passed correctly but the LLM wasn't extracting the actual data from the `result` field.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Tool Result Processing (`synthesizeResultsWithAgent`)
- Added explicit logging to track tool results
- Reformatted tool results for better LLM understanding with clear `tool_name`, `status`, and `data` fields
- Added comprehensive instructions in the system prompt about how to access tool data

### 2. Improved System Prompt
Added critical instructions:
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TOOL RESULTS:
1. You will receive tool results in a structured format with "tool_name", "status", and "data" fields
2. The "data" field contains the ACTUAL DATA retrieved from the GRC system - USE THIS DATA IN YOUR RESPONSE
3. DO NOT use placeholder values like "placeholder_application_name" or report "undefined" errors
4. If a tool succeeded (status: "success"), the data IS available in the "data" field
5. Extract and present specific information from the data field (applications, records, statistics, etc.)
6. If you see JSON data, parse it and present the relevant information clearly
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging throughout the tool execution pipeline:
- Tool selection logging
- Tool execution with inputs/outputs
- Result preview (first 200 chars)
- Synthesis tracking

### 4. Improved Tool Selection Prompt
- Added common tool patterns
- Clearer examples
- Explicit instruction to match tool names exactly

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: List Applications
**Query**: "List all Archer applications"
**Expected**: 
- Tool `get_archer_applications` should be selected
- Actual application names should be displayed (not placeholders)
- No "undefined" errors

### Test 2: Search Records
**Query**: "Show me critical risks"
**Expected**:
- Tool `search_archer_records` should be selected
- Actual risk records should be displayed
- Specific risk details presented

### Test 3: Get Statistics
**Query**: "Show risk statistics"
**Expected**:
- Tool `get_record_statistics` should be selected
- Actual statistics displayed
- Numbers and counts presented correctly

## How to Verify Fix Works

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for `[MCP Orchestration]` logs showing tool execution
   - Look for `[Synthesis]` logs showing tool results being formatted
   - Verify `Result preview:` shows actual data, not undefined

2. **Check Response Quality**:
   - Response should contain specific data points
   - No placeholder values
   - No "undefined" errors when tools succeed
   - Actual application names, risk counts, etc.

3. **Check Tool Result Structure**:
   The formatted results passed to LLM should look like:
   ```json
   {
     "tool_name": "get_archer_applications",
     "status": "success",
     "data": "Risk Register\nControls Library\nVendor Management..."
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/mcp/McpTestInterface.tsx`:
   - Enhanced `synthesizeResultsWithAgent` function
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Improved prompt instructions
   - Better tool selection examples

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Check MCP Server Response**: 
   - Verify the MCP server is returning data in the `result` field
   - Check network tab for actual API responses

2. **Verify LLM Model Support**:
   - Ensure the LLM model supports JSON parsing
   - Check if temperature settings affect response quality

3. **Test with Simple Queries First**:
   - Start with "list tools" to verify basic connectivity
   - Then try "list applications"
   - Finally test complex queries

## Success Indicators

✅ Console shows "Tool X returned: {success: true, hasResult: true}"
✅ Console shows "Result preview:" with actual data
✅ LLM response contains specific application names, not placeholders
✅ No "undefined" errors in successful tool executions
✅ Data from tools is properly synthesized into natural language response
