# Risk Analysis Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the Archer MCP Server to enhance AI agent capabilities for identifying and analyzing critical risks in GRC systems.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Privacy Protector Configuration Updates
**File**: `/src/privacy-protector.ts`

**Changes**:
- Extended the whitelist to include critical risk assessment fields
- Added fields for risk scoring, severity, impact, likelihood, and financial metrics
- Preserved visibility of active/status fields for proper filtering

**Whitelisted Risk Fields**:
```javascript
// Risk assessment fields
'risk_score', 'risk_rating', 'risk_level', 'severity', 'severity_level',
'impact', 'impact_score', 'impact_level', 'likelihood', 'likelihood_score',
'probability', 'inherent_risk', 'residual_risk', 'risk_category',
'priority', 'criticality', 'exposure', 'threat_level',

// Financial risk fields
'actual_annualized_loss_amount', 'estimated_loss', 'potential_loss',
'financial_impact', 'loss_expectancy',

// Status and classification fields
'active', 'is_active', 'record_status', 'state', 'classification',
'risk_classification', 'risk_type', 'control_effectiveness'
```

### 2. New Risk Analysis Method
**File**: `/src/index.ts`

**New Method**: `analyzeRisks()`

**Features**:
- Auto-detects risk-related fields from record structure
- Filters for active/open risks only
- Categorizes risks by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Provides risk distribution statistics
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Supports flexible sorting and filtering options

**Options**:
- `severityThreshold`: Filter by minimum severity level
- `includeOnlyActive`: Focus on current risks only
- `topN`: Limit number of risks returned
- `sortBy`: Sort by risk_score, impact, likelihood, or priority
- `includeFullData`: Analyze complete dataset vs paginated subset

### 3. New MCP Tool: analyze_risks
**Tool Definition**:
```javascript
{
  name: 'analyze_risks',
  description: 'Analyze and identify critical risks in a Risk Register',
  parameters: {
    applicationName: string,
    severityThreshold: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
    includeOnlyActive: boolean,
    topN: number,
    sortBy: string,
    includeFullData: boolean
  }
}
```

**Response Structure**:
- Risk distribution summary (critical, high, medium, low counts)
- Identified risk fields mapping
- Top risks with key metrics visible
- Actionable recommendations
- Active vs total record counts

### 4. Intelligent Risk Field Detection
The system now automatically identifies risk fields by pattern matching:
- Severity indicators: 'severity', 'criticality'
- Impact fields: 'impact', 'impact_score'
- Likelihood fields: 'likelihood', 'probability'
- Score fields: 'risk_score', 'riskscore', 'score'
- Status fields: 'status', 'state', 'active'
- Financial fields: 'annualized_loss', 'estimated_loss'

### 5. Active Record Filtering
Implements smart filtering for active risks:
- Recognizes multiple status patterns: 'active', 'open', 'current'
- Handles boolean and string status fields
- Excludes closed, mitigated, or accepted risks
- Reports filtering statistics

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Identify Critical Risks
```javascript
// AI Agent can now use:
analyze_risks({
  applicationName: "Risk Register",
  severityThreshold: "critical",
  includeOnlyActive: true,
  includeFullData: true
})

// Returns:
{
  riskSummary: {
    critical: 5,
    high: 12,
    medium: 28,
    low: 45,
    unclassified: 10
  },
  topRisks: [...], // Top critical risks with visible metrics
  recommendations: [
    "URGENT: 5 critical risks require immediate attention",
    "WARNING: 12 high-severity risks detected"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Financial Risk Analysis
```javascript
analyze_risks({
  applicationName: "Risk Register",
  sortBy: "annualized_loss",
  topN: 20,
  includeFullData: true
})

// Returns risks sorted by financial impact with loss amounts visible
```

## Benefits for AI Agents

### 1. Improved Data Visibility
- Critical risk fields are no longer masked
- Financial impact data is accessible
- Risk scores and severity levels are visible

### 2. Focused Analysis
- Active risk filtering reduces noise
- Severity thresholds enable prioritization
- Smart categorization improves insights

### 3. Actionable Outputs
- Automatic recommendations based on risk patterns
- Clear risk distribution statistics
- Identified data quality issues

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Option to analyze paginated data for speed
- Full data analysis available when needed
- Efficient field detection and mapping

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Risk Detection
```bash
# Test with sample risk data
node dist/index.js
# Use analyze_risks tool with different thresholds
```

### 2. Verify Field Detection
- Check that risk fields are properly identified
- Ensure severity categorization works correctly
- Validate active record filtering

### 3. Performance Testing
- Compare paginated vs full data analysis
- Measure response times for large datasets
- Verify memory usage is acceptable

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### Effective Prompts for AI Agents:

1. **Critical Risk Focus**:
   "Use analyze_risks to identify all critical and high-severity active risks in the Risk Register. Focus on risks requiring immediate mitigation."

2. **Financial Impact Analysis**:
   "Analyze risks sorted by annualized loss to identify the top financial exposures. Include only active risks with loss amounts greater than $1M."

3. **Risk Trend Analysis**:
   "Retrieve all risk data with includeFullData=true and analyze the distribution of risks by severity, category, and control effectiveness."

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### 1. Additional Enhancements
- Add risk trend analysis over time
- Implement risk correlation detection
- Support for risk heat maps

### 2. Integration Improvements
- Link risks to controls and incidents
- Cross-reference with compliance violations
- Connect to mitigation tracking

### 3. AI Agent Training
- Develop specific prompts for different risk scenarios
- Create templates for executive risk reporting
- Build risk assessment workflows

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the AI agent's ability to:
- Identify critical risks quickly and accurately
- Access essential risk metrics without masking
- Focus on active, actionable risks
- Provide meaningful risk analysis and recommendations

The combination of improved data visibility, dedicated risk analysis tools, and smart filtering ensures AI agents can effectively support GRC risk management workflows.
