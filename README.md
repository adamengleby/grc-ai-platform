## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd grc-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

## Key Components

### Authentication System (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Mock Azure AD B2C authentication service
- JWT token handling with tenant context
- Role-based permission checking
- Multi-tenant user management

### Dashboard Layout (`src/components/layout/`)
- Responsive sidebar with role-based navigation
- Tenant selector and user management in header
- Dark/light theme support
- Real-time notifications and alerts

### MCP Test Interface (`src/components/mcp/McpTestInterface.tsx`)
- Natural language chat interface for GRC queries
- Agent selection with tenant-scoped tools
- Confidence scoring and evidence display
- Compliance flag detection and alerts

### State Management (`src/store/`)
- Authentication state with tenant context
- Dashboard metrics and real-time data
- Type-safe Zustand stores with subscriptions

## Platform Integration

This dashboard properly integrates with the multi-tenant SaaS platform by:

### 1. **Tenant Isolation**
- All data and functionality is scoped to the authenticated tenant
- MCP tools are filtered based on tenant's approved server list
- Usage quotas and metrics are tenant-specific

### 2. **Azure AD B2C Integration**
- JWT tokens contain `tenantId` claims for proper tenant binding
- Role-based access control matches platform RBAC model
- Multi-factor authentication support for Tenant Owners

### 3. **MCP Server Compliance**
- Tools are sourced from platform-approved MCP registry
- Audit logging for all MCP tool executions
- Rate limiting and cost controls per tenant

### 4. **Platform API Gateway**
- All backend calls would route through Azure APIM
- Proper correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Error handling that matches platform error model

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to Azure Static Web Apps or App Service.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run test` - Run tests (when configured)

## Environment Configuration

For production deployment, you would configure:

- Azure AD B2C tenant and application settings
- API Gateway endpoints for backend services
- Application Insights for telemetry
- Key Vault references for sensitive configuration

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data (API keys, secrets) stored in Azure Key Vault
- HTTPS-only communication in production
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly configured
- Session management with secure token storage

## Compliance Features

- **Audit Logging**: All user actions logged with correlation IDs
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies per framework
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated compliance reports for audits

## Future Enhancements

- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Advanced analytics and machine learning insights
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Additional compliance frameworks
- Enhanced MCP tool marketplace
- Automated remediation workflows

This dashboard serves as a comprehensive example of how to build a multi-tenant SaaS application that properly integrates with modern AI platforms while maintaining strict compliance and security standards.
