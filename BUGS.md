## Active Bugs

### âœ… BUG-002: CRITICAL - Tenant Isolation Breach in Credentials API
**Status**: Fixed  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: `src/lib/credentialsApi.ts`, `src/components/archer/ArcherConnectionConfig.tsx`  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Date Reported**: 2025-08-20  
**Date Fixed**: 2025-08-20  

**Description**: 
David from the Fintech tenant was able to see Sarah's ACME tenant connections. This was a severe tenant isolation violation where credentials were stored in a global localStorage key without tenant partitioning.

**Root Cause**: 
The `CredentialsManager` class was using static storage keys (`grc_encrypted_credentials`) without tenant partitioning, causing all tenants to share the same credential storage space.

**Security Impact**:
- **Data Leakage**: Cross-tenant access to sensitive connection credentials
- **Privacy Violation**: Users could see other tenants' Archer instance configurations
- **Compliance Risk**: Violates multi-tenant security requirements and SOC2/ISO27001 standards

**Solution**: 
1. **Updated CredentialsManager** to use tenant-prefixed storage keys:
   - Added `setTenantContext(tenantId)` method
   - Changed storage keys to `grc_encrypted_credentials_{tenantId}`
   - Added tenant validation in all credential operations

2. **Updated ArcherConnectionConfig** component:
   - Set tenant context from auth store on component mount
   - Added tenant validation in all credential operations
   - Updated dependency arrays to include tenant.id

3. **Updated McpService** to set tenant context when loading connections

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `STORAGE_KEY` to `STORAGE_KEY_PREFIX` with tenant partitioning
- Added `setTenantContext()` method with validation
- Updated all credential operations to use tenant-specific keys
- Added tenant context setting in all components using credentialsManager

**Verification**:
- Each tenant now has isolated credential storage
- Cross-tenant access is prevented by tenant-specific encryption keys
- All credential operations require valid tenant context

### âœ… BUG-001: Test Connection Button Not Working  
**Status**: Fixed  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: `src/components/archer/ArcherConnectionConfig.tsx`  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Date Reported**: 2025-08-20  
**Date Fixed**: 2025-08-20  

**Description**: 
The "Test Connection" button in the Archer GRC Connections page did not function when clicked in the connection details view.

**Root Cause**: 
The `handleTestConnection` function was designed to work with `formData` (when editing), but the "Test Connection" button in the details view was called without populating `formData` from the `selectedConnection`.

**Solution**: 
Enhanced `handleTestConnection` function to:
- Detect if in editing mode (use `formData`) or details view (use `selectedConnection`)
- Convert `selectedConnection` data to proper format for testing
- Update connection status in the UI after test completion
- Provide proper error handling for both scenarios

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `handleTestConnection()` to support both editing and viewing modes
- Added logic to update connection status and timestamps after successful tests
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Fixed Issues

### âœ… FIXED-001: Blank Connections Page
**Status**: Fixed  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Component**: `src/pages/ConnectionsPage.tsx`  
**Date Fixed**: 2025-08-20  

**Description**: 
Connections page was completely blank when accessed via navigation.

**Root Cause**: 
`DashboardLayout` component was expecting routes via `<Outlet />` rather than children props.

**Solution**: 
Updated `ConnectionsPage.tsx` to render content directly without wrapping in `DashboardLayout`.
