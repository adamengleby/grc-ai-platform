# Simplified AI/ML Use Cases for Archer GRC Platform

## Use Case 1: Smart Data Quality Checker

### What It Does
Automatically reviews incidents, risks, and controls to identify issues and improve data quality.

**Example**: System reads an incident description → Flags it as "Possible Privacy Breach" → Adds proper tags → Suggests risk rating

### Required Data
| Data Type | Details | Why Needed | Source |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Incident Records** | - Incident descriptions (text)<br>- Date/time stamps<br>- Current classifications<br>- Resolution notes<br>- Severity/priority levels<br>- Business unit/location<br>- Root cause analysis<br>- Affected systems/processes | To understand patterns, identify misclassifications, and learn from resolution approaches | Archer Incidents Module |
| **Risk Register** | - Risk descriptions<br>- Risk categories<br>- Impact/likelihood scores<br>- Risk owners<br>- Inherent vs residual risk<br>- Risk treatment decisions<br>- Related controls (linkages)<br>- Risk review dates | To map risks properly and understand which risks lack controls or proper assessments | Archer Risk Module |
| **Control Library** | - Control descriptions<br>- Control types (preventive/detective)<br>- Test results & dates<br>- Control owners<br>- Control frequency<br>- Cost of control<br>- Failures/exceptions<br>- Compensating controls | To assess control effectiveness and identify weak or missing controls | Archer Controls Module |
| **Your Taxonomy** | - Organization-specific categories<br>- Regulatory frameworks<br>- Business units<br>- Approved terminology<br>- Industry standards<br>- Maturity levels | To ensure consistent classification aligned with your organization's language | Archer Configuration |
| **Historical Changes** | - Who made changes<br>- What was changed<br>- When changes occurred<br>- Change justifications<br>- Previous classifications | To learn from human corrections and improve AI accuracy over time | Archer Audit Logs |
| **Relationships/Links** | - Risk-to-control mappings<br>- Control-to-requirement mappings<br>- Incident-to-risk linkages<br>- Process dependencies | To understand coverage gaps and cascade effects | Archer Relationships |

### AI Approach
**🤖 Best Fit: GenAI + ML Classification**

- **GenAI (GPT-4 class model)**: Understands context in descriptions and suggests improvements
- **ML Classifier**: Applies consistent tags based on your taxonomy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows certainty level (e.g., "85% confident this is a privacy breach")

### How Data Gets Fed In
```
Archer → API Export → AI Processing → Results back to Archer

1. Daily batch export via Archer REST API
2. Real-time via webhooks for new entries
3. AI processes and returns:
   - Suggested classifications
   - Quality scores
   - Improvement recommendations
4. Human reviews and approves changes
5. Updates pushed back to Archer
```

## Use Case 2: Risk & Control Insights Generator

### What It Does
Analyzes all your GRC data to answer strategic questions and identify gaps.

**Examples**: 
- "What controls are we missing for cyber risks?"
- "What new risks are emerging based on recent incidents?"
- "Are we within risk appetite for financial risks?"

### Required Data
| Data Type | Details | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Historical Data** | - 2+ years of incidents<בr>- Past risk assessments<br>- Control test history<br>- Issue/finding trends | Archer Historical Data |
| **Current State** | - Active risks and ratings<br>- Control effectiveness scores<br>- Open issues/findings<br>- KRI/KPI metrics | Archer Dashboards/Reports |
| **Risk Appetite** | - Appetite statements<br>- Tolerance thresholds<br>- Target risk levels<br>- Board-approved limits | Archer Policy Module |
| **External Context** | - Industry benchmarks<br>- Regulatory changes<br>- Threat intelligence<br>- Peer comparisons | External Feeds (optional) |

### AI Approach
**🤖 Best Fit: AI Agent with Analytics Engine**

- **AI Agent**: Orchestrates multiple analyses and answers natural language questions
- **Pattern Recognition (ML)**: Finds trends and correlations in historical data
- **Predictive Models (ML)**: Forecasts emerging risks based on patterns
- **GenAI**: Generates executive summaries and recommendations in plain language

### How Data Gets Fed In
```
Multiple Archer Modules → Data Warehouse → AI Agent → Insights Dashboard

1. Nightly ETL from Archer to data warehouse
2. AI Agent queries warehouse for analysis
3. Enrichment with external data (if available)
4. Agent generates insights:
   - Missing controls list
   - Emerging risk alerts
   - Focus area recommendations
5. Results displayed in dashboard or pushed to Archer
```

## Quick Implementation Guide

### For Use Case 1 (Data Quality)
**Step 1**: Export sample data (1000 records) from Archer  
**Step 2**: Train ML classifier on your taxonomy  
**Step 3**: Connect GenAI for description analysis  
**Step 4**: Test on small batch with human review  
**Step 5**: Scale up with API integration  

### For Use Case 2 (Insights)
**Step 1**: Set up data warehouse/lake connection  
**Step 2**: Build historical data pipeline from Archer  
**Step 3**: Deploy AI Agent (e.g., using Semantic Kernel or LangChain)  
**Step 4**: Create starter queries and dashboards  
**Step 5**: Add natural language interface

## Alternative: API-Based Analysis (No Data Warehouse)

### How It Works
Instead of copying data to a warehouse, the AI agent makes real-time API calls to Archer with on-the-fly masking:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Archer    │────▶│  Masking     │────▶│  AI Agent   │────▶│   Insights   │
│   GRC       │ API │  Service     │     │  Platform   │     │  Dashboard   │
│  Platform   │◀────│ (On-the-fly) │◀────│  (Stateless)│     │              │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

### Data Privacy with Masking

**What Gets Masked:**
- Names & Identifiers: "John Smith" → "Employee_001"
- Business Units: "NYC Trading Desk" → "Unit_Region_1"
- Dollar Amounts: "$1,234,567" → "Range_1M_5M"
- System Names: "SAP_PROD_NY" → "System_Type_A"

**What Stays Intact:**
- Risk scores and ratings
- Dates and time patterns
- Categories and types
- Statistical relationships

### Implementation Example

```python
# AI Agent decides what data it needs
async def analyze_emerging_risks():
    # Step 1: Make strategic API calls
    api_calls = [
        "GET /api/risks?created_after=2024-Q4&status=active",
        "GET /api/incidents?date_range=90d&group_by=category",
        "GET /api/controls?effectiveness=low"
    ]
    
    # Step 2: Mask sensitive data on-the-fly
    masked_data = masking_service.mask(archer_response)
    
    # Step 3: AI analyzes patterns (without seeing sensitive details)
    insights = ai_agent.analyze(masked_data)
    
    # Step 4: Unmask specific items only when needed for action
    if user.has_permission('view_sensitive'):
        insights['unit'] = unmask(insights['unit_token'])
    
    return insights
```

### Advantages vs Data Warehouse

| Factor | API-Based | Data Warehouse |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Data Freshness** | Real-time | Updated daily/hourly |
| **Storage Cost** | $0 | $500-5000/month |
| **Security** | Data stays in Archer | Data duplicated |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Complex ETL |
| **Compliance** | Easier (no data movement) | Must manage two systems |
| **Performance** | Good for <1M records | Better for huge datasets |

### When to Use API-Based Approach

**✅ Perfect for:**
- Real-time insights and alerts
- Organizations with strong data privacy requirements
- Smaller datasets (< 1M records)
- Ad-hoc queries and exploratory analysis
- Proof of concept before warehouse investment

**⚠️ Consider Data Warehouse if:**
- Need complex historical analysis (5+ years)
- Very large datasets (10M+ records)
- Require sub-second response times
- Running hundreds of queries per minute

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Parallel API calls for better performance
async def gather_data_parallel():
    tasks = [
        get_masked_data('risks', params),
        get_masked_data('incidents', params),
        get_masked_data('controls', params)
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return combine_results(results)

# Smart caching for frequently used data
cache = SmartCache(ttl=300)  # 5-minute cache
data = cache.get_or_fetch(query_key, fetch_function)
```
