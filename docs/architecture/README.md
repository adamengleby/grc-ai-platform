## Key Architectural Principles

### Multi-Tenancy
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data and resource isolation between tenants
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with tenant-aware partitioning
- **Security**: Zero-trust security model with defense in depth
- **Compliance**: Built-in compliance for ISO27001, SOC2, and CPS230

### Cloud-Native Design
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Serverless**: Azure Functions for event-driven processing
- **Managed Services**: Leveraging Azure PaaS services for reliability
- **DevOps**: Automated CI/CD with infrastructure as code

### AI Integration
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized integration with AI tools and services
- **Agent Management**: Complete lifecycle management for AI agents
- **Privacy Protection**: Built-in PII detection and data masking
- **LLM Agnostic**: Support for multiple LLM providers (Azure OpenAI, BYO)

### Enterprise Features
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive, tamper-evident audit logging
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular RBAC with tenant-aware permissions
- **Data Residency**: Regional data storage with compliance requirements
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup with point-in-time recovery

## Technology Stack

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Patterns
- **Database per Tenant**: Logical isolation with shared infrastructure
- **Shared Database, Separate Schemas**: Cost-effective isolation
- **Tenant-Aware Caching**: Redis with tenant-specific namespaces
- **RBAC Integration**: Azure AD B2C with custom policies

### Integration Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management with rate limiting
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable audit logs with event replay
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns for external dependencies

### Security Patterns
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify principle
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights principle
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Quality Attributes
