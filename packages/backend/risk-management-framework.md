# Risk Management Framework for AI-Powered GRC Tools

## 1. Risk Framework Alignment

### Framework Integration Strategy

#### ISO 31000:2018 Alignment
- **Risk Identification**: AI classifies risks using ISO 31000 categories
- **Risk Analysis**: Automated likelihood × impact calculations
- **Risk Evaluation**: AI compares against risk appetite thresholds
- **Risk Treatment**: Recommendations based on 4T model (Treat, Transfer, Tolerate, Terminate)

#### COSO ERM Integration
- Map to 20 COSO principles across 5 components
- AI identifies control deficiencies per COSO criteria
- Automated assessment of entity-level vs. process-level controls

#### ISO 27001:2022 Compliance
- 93 controls across 4 themes (Organizational, People, Physical, Technological)
- AI maps incidents to Annex A controls
- Automated ISMS gap analysis

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- AI maps controls to 108 subcategories
- Maturity scoring: Initial (1) to Optimized (5)

## 2. Realistic Risk Scenarios

### Common Incident Types Requiring AI Classification

#### Data Privacy Incidents (35% of volume)
```json
{
  "incident_type": "Unauthorized Data Access",
  "frequency": "15-20 per month",
  "typical_causes": [
    "Misconfigured permissions (40%)",
    "Credential compromise (25%)",
    "Insider access abuse (20%)",
    "Third-party breach (15%)"
  ],
  "ai_classification_confidence": "85-95%",
  "regulatory_implications": ["GDPR Article 33", "CCPA breach notification"]
}
```

#### Operational Incidents (30% of volume)
```json
{
  "incident_type": "System Outage",
  "frequency": "8-12 per month",
  "typical_causes": [
    "Software deployment failure (30%)",

}
```

}
```

### Emerging Risk Patterns AI Should Detect

1. **Supply Chain Vulnerability Clusters**
   - Pattern: Multiple vendors using same vulnerable component
   - Detection: Cross-reference vendor assessments with CVE databases
   - Risk Score Increase: 40-60% when pattern detected

2. **Regulatory Change Cascades**
   - Pattern: New regulation affecting multiple business processes
   - Detection: NLP analysis of regulatory updates + process mapping
   - Lead Time: 6-12 months before enforcement

3. **Insider Threat Indicators**
   - Pattern: Unusual access patterns + life events + sentiment changes
   - Detection: Behavioral analytics + HR data correlation
   - False Positive Rate: Target <5%

4. **Control Degradation Trends**
   - Pattern: Gradual decrease in control effectiveness over time
   - Detection: Statistical process control on KCI metrics
   - Alert Threshold: 2 standard deviations from baseline

### Common Control Gaps Found in Assessments

| Control Domain | Gap Frequency | Typical Root Cause | AI Detection Confidence |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Access Management | 78% | No regular access reviews | 92% |
| Change Management | 65% | Inadequate testing procedures | 88% |
| Incident Response | 62% | No defined escalation paths | 85% |
| Data Classification | 58% | Inconsistent labeling standards | 90% |
| Vendor Management | 55% | Missing risk assessments | 87% |
| Business Continuity | 52% | Outdated recovery procedures | 83% |
| Security Training | 48% | Generic content, not role-based | 80% |

## 3. Industry-Standard Metrics

### Risk Exposure Calculation

```python
# Inherent Risk Exposure (before controls)
inherent_risk_exposure = likelihood × impact × asset_value

# Residual Risk Exposure (after controls)
residual_risk_exposure = inherent_risk_exposure × (1 - control_effectiveness)

# Example Calculation:
# Cyber attack on customer database
inherent_risk = {
    'likelihood': 0.6,  # 60% chance annually
    'impact': 0.8,      # 80% of max impact
    'asset_value': 5000000,  # $5M customer data value
    'calculation': 0.6 * 0.8 * 5000000  # = $2.4M
}

residual_risk = {
    'control_effectiveness': 0.75,  # 75% effective controls
    'calculation': 2400000 * (1 - 0.75)  # = $600K
}
```

### Control Effectiveness Measurement

```yaml
control_effectiveness_matrix:
  design_effectiveness:
    weight: 40%
    scoring:
      - fully_designed: 100%
      - mostly_designed: 75%
      - partially_designed: 50%
      - poorly_designed: 25%
      - not_designed: 0%
      
  operational_effectiveness:
    weight: 60%
    components:
      - automation_level: 20%  # Manual=0%, Semi=50%, Full=100%
      - consistency: 20%       # Measured by standard deviation
      - coverage: 20%          # % of transactions covered
      - timeliness: 20%        # Within SLA percentage
      - accuracy: 20%          # Error rate inverse

example_control_score:
  control: "Privileged Access Management"
  design_score: 85
  operational_score: 72
  weighted_total: (85*0.4) + (72*0.6) = 77.2%
  rating: "Effective with Improvements Needed"
```

### Compliance Scoring Methodologies

#### Maturity-Based Scoring (CMMI Model)
```
Level 1 - Initial (0-20%): Ad-hoc, unpredictable
Level 2 - Managed (21-40%): Reactive, project-based
Level 3 - Defined (41-60%): Proactive, organization-wide
Level 4 - Quantified (61-80%): Measured and controlled
Level 5 - Optimizing (81-100%): Continuous improvement
```

#### Binary Compliance Scoring
```
Compliant = 1, Non-Compliant = 0
Compliance % = (Compliant Controls / Total Controls) × 100
Minimum Acceptable: 95% for SOX, 98% for PCI-DSS
```

#### Risk-Weighted Compliance Score
```
Score = Σ(Control_Weight × Compliance_Status) / Σ(Control_Weights)
Where weights are based on:
- Criticality (Critical=5, High=3, Medium=2, Low=1)
- Regulatory emphasis
- Business impact
```
