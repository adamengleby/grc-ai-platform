## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@grc-ai-platform.com
2. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information
3. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, and impact assessment
4. **Response**: We will acknowledge within 24 hours and provide updates regularly

### PGP Key

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be inserted here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Classification (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- **Component**: Affected component or service
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, or environment details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: Varies by severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| High | 8 hours | 72 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | 7 days |
| Low | 72 hours | 30 days |
